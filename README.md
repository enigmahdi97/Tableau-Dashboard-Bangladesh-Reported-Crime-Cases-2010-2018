# Tableau-Dashboard-Bangladesh-Reported-Crime-Cases-2010-2018

This dashboard encompasses an extensive dataset comprising over 1.67 million reported crime cases in Bangladesh spanning over 2010-2018. The data, sourced from Kaggle then cleaned, encompasses 17 distinct units within Bangladesh, offering a comprehensive overview of the nation's crime landscape. 

Utilizing this dataset I've created this interactive dashboard, by which one can gain insights on: 
  Crime frequencies across unit regions,
  Crime frequency over time,
  Year specific & region specific frequency,
  Trends in reported specific crime types,
  Frequency of crime types across regions and time.

The insights derived from this dashboard hold significance for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and various stakeholders dedicated to fostering a safer society. Serving as a valuable resource, this dashboard facilitates a better understanding of crime patterns in Bangladesh.
